# web-Messenger-with-firebase-
web-Messenger-with-firebase using REACT JS


             -> Here I have used firebase-auth for SIGNIN and SIGNUP 
             -> then We can create our own Room ID or else use room Id created by someone ( eg : room123 )
             -> if you have created the room ID share that with your friends and have fun ... 
             -> There are many security bugs to be fixed ... but this project is awesome for beginners ..
